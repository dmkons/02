#Progress Report - Exercise 2 TDT4255, 
NTNU Autumn 2013

##What we have done so far
We started working on the assignment on the 16th of October 2013, but have not spent much time on it yet.
We have started working on the top level of our processor, and a bit of work have been put into the pipeline and control unit.

##Our plan for the rest of the assignment
We have not come very far yet, but have a goal of getting the code done by the 5th of November.
This will give us plenty of time to test and write the report.
This will be achieved by not implementing more than the basic specifications first, and then extend with more functionality if there is still time left.
