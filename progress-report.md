# Progress Report

We started working on the assignment on the 16th of October 2013, but have not spent much time on it yet.
We have started working on the top level of our processor, and a bit of work have been put into the pipeline and control unit.

We have not come very far yet, but have a goal of getting the code done by the 5th of November.
This will be achived by not implementing more than the basic spesifications first, and then extend with more functionality if there is still time left.
